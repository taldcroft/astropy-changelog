# astropy-changelog: utility for managing the astropy changelog (demo)

This is a proof of concept (POC) for changing the basis of the astropy changelog from
the `CHANGES.rst` file to a new `CHANGES.yml` file.  The driver for this and initial
discussions were captured in an astropy-dev email thread in Oct 2016 (subject
"Proposal for a new changelog system").

An important point to note is that the current code strives to maintain
smooth compatibility with the current `CHANGES.rst` as a source for
users and developers to understand astropy changes.  

**However**, once
we have transitioned to a YAML structured representation then there
are numerous possibilities for using this far more effectively and
providing much better ways to present and discover this information.
One simple idea is to break up the output RST file by version, e.g.
`CHANGES-4.0.rst`, `CHANGES-3.2.1.rst`, and so on. This is not
currently practical because change entries commonly apply to
multiple versions.

## Overview

The key element of this POC is the script `convert_changelog.py`.  It can handle
the following:

- Read a changelog from the legacy `CHANGES.rst` RST format and convert
  into a structured data changelog object (list of change entries, where each
  entry is a dict).
- Read a changelog from the new `CHANGES.yml` YAML format directly into a
  structured changelog object.
- Write a structured changelog object to YAML.
- Write a structured changelog object into the legacy RST format.  One key
  difference is that it does not preserve the empty subpackage entries, e.g.
  when there are no bug fixes for a particular subpackage, that is simply not
  reported.

The changelog YAML file contains four documents:

- Instructions for developers to add a changelog entry
- Template that they use
- Release dates (needed to generate the RST legacy format)
- Change entries

## Envisioned process for astropy package maintainers

The envisioned process is to convert from `CHANGES.rst` to `CHANGES.yml` and
then convert back to RST to verify that the YAML representation accurately
captures the original changelog:
```
./convert_changelog.py CHANGES.rst CHANGES.yml
./convert_changelog.py CHANGES.yml CHANGES_new.rst

# Diff the two, preferably using a graphical diff too.  opendiff works well on Mac.
opendiff CHANGES.rst CHANGES_new.rst
```

At this point `CHANGES.yml` becomes the official source of changes and
`CHANGES.rst` is a derived product that is generated (by some TBD process) with:
```
./convert_changelog.py CHANGES.yml CHANGES.rst
```

## Process for astropy core contributors

The goal is that the instructions in the `CHANGES.yml` file are clear and self-contained,
and that merge conflicts will be avoided by placing new change entries at a quasi-random
location within the file.

## Example files

To allow looking at the files in a manageable form, this repo includes a
chopped down version of the astropy changelog as `changes_test.rst`.  From there:
```
./convert_changelog.py changes_test.rst changes_test.yml
./convert_changelog.py changes_test.yml changes_test_new.rst
./convert_changelog.py --line-width=80 changes_test.yml changes_test_new-80.rst
```
